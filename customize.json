Watching you grow and thrive is such an inspiration to me, and it always motivates me to push myself to be better, too. That's why I call you my enemy, because you challenge me in the best possible way. But honestly, you're more like voice of reason, always pushing me to be my best self. Here's to another year of Enemyship (probably not a real word), growth, and unforgettable moments. I had fun whether it's unraveling the mysteries of an iceberg , seeing mischievous joy of a childish demon, guided by wisdom and bravery of Hermione ",
